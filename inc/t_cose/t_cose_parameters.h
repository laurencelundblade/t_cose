/*
 * Header parameter encoding and decoding hinges around struct
 * t_cose_header_param plus primary functions for encoding and decoding
 * the header. Users of the t_cose public API for verifying signing,
 * encrypting, decrypting and MACing will mainly use struct
 * t_cose_header_param.
 *
 * Struct t_cose_header_param holds a single header parameter that is
 * to be encoded or has been decoded. The same structure is used for
 * both. Most parameters are either integers, strings or Booleans and
 * are held directly in struct t_cose_header_param. A callback is used
 * for more complex parameters.
 *
 * The struct t_cose_header_param also holds:
 *   * Whether the parameter is protected or not
 *   * Whether the parameter is critical
 *   * The label for the parameter
 *   * The data type of the parameter
 *   * The location of the parameter in the COSE message
 *
 * Only integer parameter labels are supported.
 *
 * When encoding a COSE message and only the kid and algorithm id are
 * needed, there is no need to use the header parameter structure as
 * those are handled internally. If further parameters are needed when
 * encoding further the caller creates an array of struct
 * t_cose_header_param passes it in with xxxx_add_parameters(). This
 * array is terminated by a header parameter structure with type
 * T_COSE_PARAMETER_TYPE_NONE. This array can contain only one, or a large number of
 * parameters, can contain protected or unprotected headers, critical
 * or not-critical headers and headers of any data type.
 *
 * If the data type to encode is complex, for example the parameter
 * itself is a map, then an encoding callback must be implemented that
 * will output the parameter to a QCBOR encode context.  The pointer to
 * this function goes in the struct t_cose_header_param. It will be
 * called back during the encoding of the COSE message.
 *
 * If any header parameters for encoding are marked critical, the crit
 * header parameter will be automatically added to the COSE message.
 *
 * When decoding a COSE message (verification or decryption) the full
 * set of header parameters decoded are returned as a pointer to an
 * array of struct t_cose_header_param terminated by one with the type
 * T_COSE_PARAMETER_TYPE_NONE. In many cases the caller will not need to examine what is
 * returned.
 *
 * If the caller wishes to examine them, they can iterate over the
 * array searching by label to find the parameter of interest. The data
 * type, protected-ness and criticality of the parameters is not
 * checked. It is up to the caller examining these to check.
 *
 * Some functions for examining headers in the array are provided. See
 * t_cose_find_parameter(), t_cose_find_parameter_kid(), etcâ€¦ These do
 * fully check the protected-ness, criticality and type of the
 * parameter.
 *
 * When the data type of the header parameter is not an integer,
 * string or boolean, then a read callback must be supplied. This will
 * be called during the decoding of the COSE message with a QCBOR
 * decode context. The callback must alway correctly consume the whole
 * encoded CBOR. The callback can store what it decodes in a
 * context. The callback must do checking for criticality and
 * protractedness of the parameter and error out if they are not
 * correct.
 *
 * If fewer than 10 (TBD) header parameters are in the COSE message,
 * then storage for the returned header parameter structures is
 * provided from the verifier/decryptor context. If more are
 * encountered, the message decode will error out.
 *
 * If it is expected that more than 10 parameters may occur, the
 * caller should provide a larger storage array for header parameters
 * by calling t_cose_xxxx_add_parameter_storage().
 *
 * Some COSE messages, COSE_Sign1, COSE_Mac0 and COSE_Encrypt0 have
 * just one set of headers those for the main body. The other messages,
 * COSE_Sign, COSE_Encrypt and COSE_Mac have body headers and
 * additionally headers per recipient or signer. These scenarios are
 * also handled here.
 *
 * When encoding, the multiple header sets are handled in the
 * interface for signing, encrypting and such. There are separate
 * functions for passing in the body header and the header per signer
 * and per recipient.
 *
 * When decoding all the headers for the entire message are returned
 * in one. The caller can know which parameters are for the body and an
 * index number for the recipient or signer. Even the nesting of
 * recipients within recipients is indicated.
 *
 * Note that decoding messages with many signers or recipients is when
 * you will probably have to add storage for header parameters. Even
 * though the algorithm ID is handled internally, there is still
 * storage needed for it for every signer or recipient.
 *
 * As mentioned in the beginning there is one main function for
 * encoding headers, t_cose_encode_headers() and a complimentary one
 * for decoding headers, t_cose_decode_headers(). These are mostly used
 * internally to implement the main public APIs for signing, encrypting
 * and MACing, but they are also available publicly for add-on
 * implementations of different types of signers and recipients.
 *
 * The primary input to t_cose_encode_headers() is a list of struct
 * t_cose_header_param to encode and the QCBOR encoder context to
 * output them too. Similarly the primary input to
 * t_cose_decode_headers() is a QCBOR decoder context to decode from
 * the output is an array of struct t_cose_header_param. Both of these
 * functions handle both the protected and unprotected headers all in
 * one call (since they always occur together in COSE).

/* TODO: remove these design notes
A callback supply by the caller that is called for 1) body and signer headers
 and 2) protected and unprotected headers.

It is called repeatedely for each until the call back says done.

 It is given a decode context to output the headers to

 It is given a headers gen context that is caller defined


 More simply the caller may fill in a simple_header struct and
 call register header.

 Have to distinguish which header goes with which signer.
 TODO: how should this work?

On verifying...

 Can register a call back that is called on every header. Two
 types of call backs
  - One for those that need decoding
  - One for those can be presented as a simple_header


 A header set object?
 - protected and non protected
 - a list of headers
 - some are data structures with pointers
 - some have to be done with call back for reading and writing





 When writing parameters,
 - Fill in HP structure, protected or not
 - - Can be specific like algID
 - - Can be general (label and value)
 - - Can be a function that writes them out

 - Add them to the recipient, signer or body instance

 Memory for HP's is allocated by the caller


 When reading parameters, it is more complicated...
 - 4 are supplied by default
 - The caller supplies an array of HP structures
 - They are filled in
 - There is an error if enough are not supplied

 Call back while verifying and/or while decoding-only. Will
 have to seek to value or caller has to get the
 label in the call back.

5 parameters supported by default -- adds about 150 bytes
 to memory requirements.

 Allow supplying of a bigger buffer if needed.

 Which is it
  - linked list
  - array is cleanest
  - accessor function


 What about decoding complicated headers?

 - Could return a bstr with the header value, but that would require
 a change to QCBOR. The caller has to run a new QCBORDecoder on it,
 but otherwise it is very clean. It can go into the header
 structure we have. No call backs needed!

 - Could have a callback with the decoder context positioned to read the
 header. They would get the label and value. They have to
 consume the whole header correctly to not mess up the decode.

 return a decoder context and expect the caller to
 decode. It would be hard to stop the decoder at the value.
 They'd get the label and the value. Could be fixed with a change
 to QCBOR.
