/**
 * \file t_cose_sign_sign.h
 *
 * \brief Create a \c COSE_Sign or \c COSE_Sign1 message.
 *
 * This creates a \c COSE_Sign1 of \c COSE_Sign message in compliance with
 * [COSE (RFC 8152)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152).
 * A \c COSE_Sign1 or \c COSE_Sign message is a CBOR encoded binary blob that contains
 * header parameters, a payload and a signature or signatures.
 *
 * This implementation is intended to be small and portable to
 * different OS's and platforms. Its dependencies are:
 * - [QCBOR](https://github.com/laurencelundblade/QCBOR)
 * - <stdint.h>, <string.h>, <stddef.h>
 * - Hash functions like SHA-256
 * - Signing functions like ECDSA
 *
 * This must be configured with a signer, an instance of \ref t_cose_signature_sign,
 * to function. This signer is what produces the actual signature. An example
 * of a signer is \ref t_cose_signature_sign_ecdsa. See t_cose_sign_add_signer().
 *
 * There is a cryptographic adaptation layer defined in
 * t_cose_crypto.h.  An implementation can be made of the functions in
 * it for different cryptographic libraries. This means that different
 * integrations with different cryptographic libraries may support
 * only signing with a particular set of algorithms. Integration with
 * [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org) is supported.  Key ID look up
 * also varies by different cryptographic library integrations.
 *
 * This implementation has a mode where a CBOR-format payload can be
 * output directly into the output buffer. This saves having two
 * copies of the payload in memory. For this mode use
 * t_cose_sign_encode_start() and
 * t_cose_sign_encode_finish(). For a simpler API that just takes
 * the payload as an input buffer use t_cose_sign_sign().
 *
 * See t_cose_common.h for preprocessor defines to reduce object code
 * and stack use by disabling features.

/**
 * This is the context for creating a \c COSE_Sign1 or \c COSE_Sign structure. The
 * caller should allocate it and pass it to the functions here.  This
 * is about 36  bytes so it fits easily on the stack.

/**
 * TODO: maybe move support for this to the test signer object.
 * This selects a signing test mode called _short_ _circuit_
 * _signing_. This mode is useful when there is no signing key
 * available, perhaps because it has not been provisioned or
 * configured for the particular device. It may also be because the
 * public key cryptographic functions have not been connected up in
 * the cryptographic adaptation layer.
 *
 * It has no value for security at all. Data signed this way MUST NOT
 * be trusted as anyone can sign like this.
 *
 * In this mode, the signature is the hash of that which would
 * normally be signed by the public key algorithm. To make the
 * signature the correct size for the particular algorithm, instances
 * of the hash are concatenated to pad it out.
 *
 * This mode is very useful for testing because all the code except
 * the actual signing algorithm is run exactly as it would if a proper
 * signing algorithm was run. This can be used for end-end system
 * testing all the way to a server or relying party, not just for
 * testing device code as t_cose_sign1_verify() supports it too.

 * \param[in] out_buf  Pointer and length of buffer to output to.
 * \param[out] result  Pointer and length of the resulting \c COSE_Sign1 or \c COSE_Sign.
 *
 * The \c context must have been initialized with
 * t_cose_sign_sign_init() and the key set with
 * t_cose_sign_add_signer() before this is called.
 *
 * This creates the COSE header parameter, hashes and signs the
 * payload and creates the signature all in one go. \c out_buf gives
 * the pointer and length of the memory into which the output is
 * written. The pointer and length of the completed \c COSE_Sign1 is
 * returned in \c result.  (\c out_buf and \c result are used instead
 * of the usual in/out parameter for length because it is the
 * convention for q_useful_buf and is more const correct.)
 *
 * The size of \c out_buf must be the size of the payload plus
 * overhead for formating, the signature and the key id (if used). The
 * formatting overhead is minimal at about 30 bytes.The total overhead
 * is about 150 bytes for ECDSA 256 with a 32-byte key ID.
 *
 * To compute the size of the buffer needed before it is allocated
 * call this with \c out_buf containing a \c NULL pointer and large
 * length like \c UINT32_MAX.  The algorithm and key, kid and such
 * must be set up just as if the real \c COSE_Sign1 were to be created
 * as these values are needed to compute the size correctly.  The
 * contents of \c result will be a \c NULL pointer and the length of
 * the \c COSE_Sign1. When this is run like this, the cryptographic
 * functions will not actually run, but the size of their output will
 * be taken into account to give an exact size.
 *
 * This function requires the payload be complete and formatted in a
 * contiguous buffer. The resulting COSE message also
 * contains the payload preceded by the header parameters and followed
 * by the signature, all CBOR formatted. This function thus requires
 * two copies of the payload to be in memory.  Alternatively
 * t_cose_sign_encode_start() and
 * t_cose_sign_encode_finish() can be used. They are more complex
 * to use, but avoid the two copies of the payload and can reduce
 * memory requirements by close to half.
 *
 * See t_cose_sign_encode_signature_aad() for more details
 * about AAD.  For many use cases there is no AAD and \c aad is \c NULL_Q_USEFUL_BUF_C.
