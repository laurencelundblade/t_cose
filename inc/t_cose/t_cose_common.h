/*
 * API Design Overview
 * 
 * t_cose is made up of a collection of objects (in the
 * object-oriented programming sense) that correspond to the main
 * objects defined in CDDL by the COSE standard (RFC 9052). These
 * objects come in pairs, one for the sendi *ng/signing/encrypting
 * side and the other for the receiving/verifying/decrypting
 * side. Following is a high-level description of all of these and how
 * they connect up to each other.
 *
 * Some of this is implemented and some of this is a design proposal,
 * so it is subject to some change, renaming and such as the
 * implementation completes.
 *
 *
 * COSE_Sign and COSE_Sign1
 *
 * t_cose_sign_sign() and t_cose_sign_verify() are the pair that
 * implements both COSE_Sign and COSE_Sign1 COSE messages.
 *
 * They rely on implementations of t_cose_signature_sign and
 * t_cose_signature_verify to create and to verify the
 * COSE_Signature(s) that are in a COSE_Sign. They are also used to
 * create the signature for COSE_Sign1. These two are an abstract
 * base class they are just an interface without an implementation.
 *
 * t_cose_headers_decode() and t_cose_headers_encode() are also used
 * by the t_cose_sign pair. These process both the protected and
 * unprotected header parameter buckets called Headers in COSE.
 *
 *
 * COSE_Encrypt and COSE_Encrypt0
 *
 * t_cose_encrypt_enc() and t_cose_encrypt_dec() are the pair for
 * COSE_Encrypt and COSE_Encrypt0.
 *
 * t_cose_headers_decode() and t_cose_headers_encode() are used for
 * the header parameters.
 *
 * This makes use of implementations of t_cose_recipient_enc and
 * t_cose_recipient_dec for COSE_recipient used by COSE_Encrypt. They
 * are not needed for COSE_Encrypt0.
 *
 *
 * COSE_Mac and COSE_Mac0
 *
 * t_cose_mac_auth() and t_cose_mac_check() are the pair for COSE_Mac
 * and COSE_Mac0.
 *
 * t_cose_headers_decode() and t_cose_headers_encode() are used for
 * the header parameters.
 *
 * For COSE_Mac, t_cose_recipient_enc() and t_cose_recipient_dec()
 * implement COSE_recipient. (I’m pretty sure sharing t_cose_recipient
 * between COSE_MAC and COSE_Encrypt can work, but this needs to be
 * checked by actually de *signing and implementing it). These are not
 * needed for COSE_Mac0.
 *
 * 
 * COSE_Message
 *
 * t_cose_message_create() and t_cose_message_decode handle
 * COSE_Message. This is for handling COSE messages that might signed,
 * encrypted, MACed or some combination of these. In the simplest case
 * they decode the CBOR tag n *umber and switch off to one of the
 * above handlers. In more complicated cases they recursively handled
 * nested signing, encrypting and MACing. (Lots of work to do on
 * this…)
 *
 *
 * Headers
 *
 * t_cose_headers_decode() and t_cose_headers_encode() handle the
 * protected and unprotected header parameter buckets that are used by
 * all the COSE messages.
 *
 * This also defines a data structure, t_cose_header_parameter that
 * holds one single parameter, for example an algorithm ID or a
 * kid. This structure is used to pass the parameters in and out of
 * all the methods above. It fa *cilitates the general header
 * parameter implementation and allows for custom and specialized
 * headers.
 *
 *
 * COSE_signature
 *
 * t_cose_signature_sign and t_cose_signature_verify are abstract
 * bases classes for a set of implementations of COSE_Signature. This
 * design is chosen because there are a variety of signature schemes
 * to implement. Mostly th *ese correspond to different signing
 * algorithms, but there is enough variation from algorithm to
 * algorithm that the use of an abstract base class here makes sense.
 *
 * The concrete classes will generally correspond to groups of
 * algorithms. For example, there will likely be one for ECDSA,
 * t_cose_signature_sign_ecdsa, another for RSAPSS and a variety for
 * PQ. Perhaps there will be one fo *r counter signatures of
 * particular types.
 *
 * The user of t_cose will create instances of t_cose_signature and
 * configure them into t_cose_sign_sign() and t_cose_sign_verify().
 *
 *
 * COSE_recipient
 *
 * t_cose_recipient_enc and t_cose_recipient_dec are abstract base
 * classes for the set of concrete implementations of
 * COSE_recipient. Because the variation in one type of COSE_recipient
 * to another is so varied, this is whe *re the abstract base class is
 * necessary.
 *
 * Note that this use object-orientation here gives some very nice
 * modularity and extensibility. New types of COSE_recipient can be
 * added to COSE_Encrypt and COSE_Mac without changing their
 * implementation at all. It is als *o possible to add new types of
 * recipients without even modifying the main t_cose library.
 *
 * 
 * COSE_Key 
 *
 * Some formats of COSE_recipient have parameters that are in the
 * COSE_key format. It would be useful to have some library code to
 * handle these, in particular to encode and decode from the key data
 * structure used by the cr *ypto library (OpenSSL, PSA, …).
