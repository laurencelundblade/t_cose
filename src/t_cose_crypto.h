/**
 * \file t_cose_crypto.h
 *
 * \brief This defines the adaptation layer for cryptographic
 * functions needed by t_cose.
 *
 * This is  small wrapper around the cryptographic functions to:
 * - Map COSE algorithm IDs to cryptographic library IDs
 * - Map cryptographic library errors to \ref t_cose_err_t errors
 * - Have inputs and outputs be \c struct \c q_useful_buf_c and
 *   \c struct \c q_useful_buf
 * - Handle key selection
 *
 * An implementation must be made of these functions
 * for the various cryptographic libraries that are used on
 * various platforms and OSs. The functions are:
 *   - t_cose_t_crypto_sig_size()
 *   - t_cose_crypto_pub_key_sign()
 *   - t_cose_crypto_pub_key_verify()
 *   - t_cose_crypto_hash_start()
 *   - t_cose_crypto_hash_update()
 *   - t_cose_crypto_hash_finish()
 *
 * This runs entirely off of COSE-style algorithm identifiers.  They
 * are simple integers and thus work nice as function parameters. An
 * initial set is defined by [COSE (RFC 8152)]
 * (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8152). New ones can be registered
 * in the [IANA COSE Registry]
 * (https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml). Local use new
 * ones can also be defined (\c \#define) if what is needed is not in
 * the IANA registry.
 *
 * \anchor useful_buf_use
 * Binary data is returned to the caller using a \c struct \c
 * q_useful_buf to pass the buffer to receive the data and its length in
 * and a \c q_useful_buf_c to return the pointer and length of the
 * returned data. The point of this is coding hygiene. The buffer
 * passed in is not const as it is to be modified.  The \c
 * q_useful_buf_c returned is const. The lengths of buffers are
 * handled in a clear, consistent and enforced manner.
 *
 * The pointer in the \c q_useful_buf_c will always point to the
 * buffer passed in via the \c q_useful_buf so the lifetime of the
 * data is under control of the caller.
 *
 * This is not intended as any sort of general cryptographic API. It
 * is just the functions needed by t_cose in the form that is most
 * useful for t_cose.
 *
 * No other file in t_cose should need modification for new algorithms,
 * new key types and sizes or the integration of cryptographic libraries
 * except on some occasions, this file as follows:
 *
 * - Support for a new T_COSE_ALGORITHM_XXX signature algorithm
 *    - See t_cose_algorithm_is_ecdsa()
 *    - If not ECDSA add another function like t_cose_algorithm_is_ecdsa()
 * - Support for a new T_COSE_ALGORITHM_XXX signature algorithm is added
 *    - See \ref T_COSE_CRYPTO_MAX_HASH_SIZE for additional hashes
 * - Support another hash implementation that is not a service
 *    - See struct \ref t_cose_crypto_hash
 *
 * To reduce stack usage and save a little code these can be defined.
 *    - T_COSE_DISABLE_ES384
 *    - T_COSE_DISABLE_ES512
 *
 * The actual code that implements these hashes in the crypto library may
 * or may not be saved with these defines depending on how the library
 * works, whether dead stripping of object code is on and such.
 */



/* This sets the maximum key size for symmetric ciphers like AES and ChaCha20 (not supported yet).
* It is set to 32 to accommodate AES 256 and anything with a smaller
* key size. This is used to size stack buffers that hold keys.
* Attempts to use a symmetric key size larger than this will result in an error.
* Smaller keys sizes are no problem.
* This could be more dynamically sized based on which algorithms
* are turned on or off, but probably isn't necessary because
* it isn't very large and dynamic setting wouldn't save much stack.

 * There is a stack variable to hold the output of the signing

 * key could be given for signing or verification that is larger than
 * this. However, it is not typical to do so. If the key or signature
 * is too large the failure will be graceful with an error.
 *
 * For ECDSA the signature format used is defined in RFC 8152 section
 * 8.1. It is the concatenation of r and s, each of which is the key
 * size in bits rounded up to the nearest byte.  That is twice the key
 * size in bytes.
 *
 * RSA signatures are typically much larger than this, but do not need
 * to be stored on the stack, since the COSE format is the same as the
 * one OpenSSL understands natively. The stack variable therefore does
 * not need to be made large enough to fit these signatures.

 * \retval T_COSE_ERR_KEY_IMPORT_FAILED
 *         The provided symmetric key could not be imported.
 *
 * This is part of the crypto adaptor layer because there is an easy
 * universal representation of a symmetric key -- a byte
 * string (this is not true for public key algorithms, so
 * there isn't similar for them (yet)).
 *
 * Some crypto libraries support key usage policy. For example, a key
 * marked only to be used for decryption can't be used for
 * encryption. The t_cose crypto adaptor layer doesn't support this
 * for symmetric keys in the interest of code size, because it isn't
 * universal and because it is not a critical security feature.  That
 * is why this API has no usage flags and implementations of this for
 * libraries that do have usage policy should allow all usage
 * policies.
 *
 * Note however that many key handles used in t_cose just pass through
 * to to the crypto library in a struct t_cose_key. For these the key
 * usage will be enforced. For example, a signing key passed into to
 * t_cose_sign will pass through to the library's sign API which will
 * enforce the usage with t_cose non the wiser.
